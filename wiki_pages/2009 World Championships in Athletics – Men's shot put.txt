The Men's Shot Put event at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on August 15.  The Olympic champion Tomasz Majewski entered the competition as the world-leading athlete and one of the favourites. Much was expected of the four-man United States team, consisting of defending champion Reese Hoffa, Olympic silver medalist Christian Cantwell, former world champion Adam Nelson, and newcomer Dan Taylor.Cantwell won the competition, recording a world-leading 22.03 m throw to fend off second-placed Majewski (who managed 21.91 m). Former champions Hoffa and Nelson were beaten to the bronze medal by German Ralf Bartels, who threw a new personal best of 21.37 m to win the host nation's first medal of the tournament.

Absolute Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution that works on older hardware and is based on Slackware Linux. The client is designed for everyday use (internet, multimedia, documents). Absolute Linux's default window and file managers are IceWM and ROX-Filer. Some of the programs offered by default include: GIMP, LibreOffice, Firefox, Xfburn, p7zip and qBittorrent. Many script utilities are included with Absolute Linux to aid with configuration and maintenance of the system.
Absolute Linux uses a graphical frontend to XPKGTOOL. Absolute Linux also bundles Gsplat, a Graphical frontend to Slapt-get which works similarly to Apt-get.

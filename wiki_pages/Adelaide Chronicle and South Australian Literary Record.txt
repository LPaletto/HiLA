The Adelaide Chronicle (full title: The Adelaide Chronicle, and South Australian Literary Record) was an early publication in Adelaide, the capital of the then colony of South Australia. It was published between 1839 (1839) and 1842 (1842), when it ceased publication as a result of the economic depression caused by the mass exodus of workers to the Victorian goldfields.

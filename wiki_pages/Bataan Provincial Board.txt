The Bataan Provincial Board is the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial legislature) of the Philippine province of Bataan.
The members are elected via plurality-at-large voting: the province is divided into two districts, each sending five members to the provincial board; the electorate votes for five members, with the five candidates with the highest number of votes being elected. The vice governor is the ex officio presiding officer, and only votes to break ties. The vice governor is elected via the plurality voting system province-wide.
The districts used in electing board members are coextensive with the legislative districts of Bataan.

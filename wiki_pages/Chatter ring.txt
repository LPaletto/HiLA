A chatter ring (also known as gyro ring, jitter ring) is a New Zealand toy ring of thick metal wire with several beads. The toy is used by swiping the beads to get them spinning, while keeping the ring turning. Around fifty thousand rings were purchased in New Zealand at department stores, street markets and dairies in 1996, and was a popular Christmas gift for children that year. During this time, there were several mentions of chatter rings on both radio and television.

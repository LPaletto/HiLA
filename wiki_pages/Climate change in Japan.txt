Climate change is already affecting Japan, and the Japanese government is increasingly enacting policy to respond.  However, its climate change policy has been described as "dirty" and the government criticised for lacking a credible plan to get to its pledged net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligations to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps related to curbing climate change.

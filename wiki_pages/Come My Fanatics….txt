Come My Fanatics… is the second studio album by English heavy metal band Electric Wizard. The album was released in January 1997 on Rise Above Records and was produced by Rolf Startin, Mike Hurst and band member Jus Oborn. It was the group's follow-up to their eponymous album Electric Wizard. Oborn described the release as a reaction to the music on the earlier album, which he had felt was not as heavy as he wanted the group to sound. The songs on Come My Fanatics… were described by Lee Dorrian, Rise Above Records owner, as breaking from the traditional doom metal style, with an unpolished and chaotic approach.
The thematic elements of the album draw from 1970s horror films, biker movies and the writings of H. P. Lovecraft; there are three songs about leaving Earth to avoid an impending environmental disaster. The album release was followed by a tour with the band Cathedral and positive reviews from heavy metal magazines Metal Hammer, Terrorizer and Kerrang!. Come My Fanatics… continued to receive praise in retrospective reviews, with Terrorizer declaring it "the wake-up that the UK doom scene needed" and Dorrian describing it as "the turning point of everything".

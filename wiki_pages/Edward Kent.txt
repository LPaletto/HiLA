Edward Kent (January 8, 1802 – May 19, 1877) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 12th and 15th Governor of Maine. He was among the last prominent members of the Whig Party in Maine before it collapsed in favor of the Republicans. He is the only Maine governor to have been elected to two non-consecutive terms (1838–39 and 1841–42), though his second term was through direct appointment by the Whig-dominated Maine Legislature.

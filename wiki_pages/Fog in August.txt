Fog in August (German: Nebel im August) is a 2016 German drama film directed by Kai Wessel. It is based on the 2008 novel Fog in August by Robert Domes, and is inspired by the documented true story of the 14 year old Yenish boy Ernst Lossa (1929â€“1944). It was listed as one of eight films that could be the German submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, but it was not selected.

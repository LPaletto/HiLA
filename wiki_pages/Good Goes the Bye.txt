"Good Goes the Bye" is a song by American singer Kelly Clarkson from her seventh studio album, Piece by Piece (2015). 
Produced by Jason Halbert and Eric Olson, the song closes the standard edition of the album and was written by country music songwriters Shane McAnally, Natalie Hemby, and Jimmy Robbins. Originally penned as a country song, Clarkson, Halbert, and Olson revamped it into a synthpop record, inspired by the 1980s pop music the British musical duo Eurythmics. A beat-driven track, the song is about ending a failing relationship. "Good Goes the Bye" received its premiere on Viacom Media Networks's three channels, MTV, VH1, and CMT on March 2, 2015, the day before the album's release.
Lauded for its lovelorn closing of the album, "Good Goes the Bye" has received a positive reception from music critics. Following the release of Piece by Piece, it debuted on the South Korean Gaon Download Chart and The Official Finnish Airplay Chart as an album cut.

Goribor (Serbian Cyrillic: Горибор; trans. Burningbor) is a Serbian alternative rock band from Bor. Having performed as a teenage band called Projekat (Serbian Cyrillic: Пројекат; trans. The Project) from 1988 until 1992, after a four-year hiatus, the band was reformed in 1996 by the founding members, the vocalist Aleksandar Stojković "St" and guitarist Željko Ljubić "Pity" with the guitarist Predrag Marković "Peđa". Until 2003 they had been making home-made demo recordings eventually released through the Croatian independent record label Slušaj Najglasnije!, after being discovered by the head of the label Zdenko Franjić.
In 2006 Franjić sent their recordings to the Pula Art & Music festival demo competition on which they eventually won the second place and were praised for a unique rock expression. The success at the festival gave them an opportunity to release a studio album through a major record label Dancing Bear. Simultaneously the band had become popular in Serbia as well. Their eponymous debut studio album Goribor received positive critics and several awards in both Serbia and Croatia, including the webzine Popboks award for the best album in the previous decade.

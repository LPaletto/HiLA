Grisi siknis (in Miskito language, from English, means "crazy sickness") is a contagious, culture-bound syndrome that occurs predominantly among the Miskito people of eastern Central America and affects mainly young women. It is also known as "grisi munaia", "Chipil siknis", and "Nil siknis". More recently, cases occurring amongst people of Spanish descent have also been reported.

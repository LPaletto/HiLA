Interstate 80 (I-80) in the U.S. state of Nebraska runs east from the Wyoming state border across the state to Omaha. Construction of the stretch of I-80 spanning the state was completed on October 19, 1974. Nebraska was the first state in the nation to complete its mainline Interstate Highway System.Nebraska has over 80 exits along Interstate 80. According to The New York Times there are several notable tourist attractions along Nebraska's section of I-80.  It is the only Interstate Highway in the state to go from one end of the state to another, as Nebraska has no major northâ€“south interstate route. Except for a 3-mile-long (4.8 km) portion of I-76 near the Colorado state line, I-80 is the only primary (two-digit) Interstate Highway in Nebraska.

KREM (channel 2) is a television station in Spokane, Washington, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside CW affiliate KSKN (channel 22). Both stations share studios on South Regal Street in the Southgate neighborhood of Spokane, while KREM's transmitter is on Krell Hill to the southeast.
The station is carried on cable systems in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, both of which are double the size of KREM's American coverage area. One result of this is that stations in Calgary and Edmonton air American shows on Pacific Time, even though Calgary and Edmonton are both on Mountain Time. It is one of five local Spokane area television stations seen in Canada on the Shaw Direct satellite service. It can also been seen on local cable systems in eastern British Columbia.
While KREM is the primary CBS affiliate for the Spokane market, Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned KLEW-TV (channel 3), based in Lewiston, Idaho, also is a CBS affiliate. However, it focuses on the southern portion of the market. Both KREM and KLEW are available on Dish Network and DirecTV throughout the Spokane market.

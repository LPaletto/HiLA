Khanom khrok or coconut-rice pancakes (Thai: ขนมครก, pronounced [kʰā.nǒm kʰrók]) is a traditional Thai dessert. They are prepared by mixing rice flour, sugar, and coconut milk to form a dough. Usually, khanom khrok is composed of two batters, one salty and one sweet, both of which are cooked in a heating mantle–a hot indented frying pan.  After heating, khanom khrok will be picked out of the mantle and the two half-circular doughs formed into a circular shape.
Khanom khrok is fragrant, sweet and the texture is also smooth from the coconut milk. Similar dishes can also be found in Bangladesh, Myanmar (where it is known as mont lin maya), Laos, Cambodia, South India (where it is called as Paddu, Paniyaram or Gundpongalu) and Indonesia (where it is called serabi).

The Landis Report was written by James M. Landis as a transition team analysis of the United States' administrative agencies for incoming President John F. Kennedy on December 21, 1960.  
A long-time friend of the Kennedy family, Landis served as a legal advisor to Joseph P. Kennedy and was President Kennedy's Special Counsel. At the time of the report, Landis was on the faculty of Harvard Law School. The report recommended greater clarity on the roles and authority of agency chairs. The Kennedy Administration adopted many of the report's recommendations.

The Guardian, in his obituary, called him "one of the last survivors of the heroic age of archaeology". As Director and Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society from 1945 until 1975, he helped organize the first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.Born in Cork, Ireland, Kirwan matriculated at Merton College, Oxford in 1925, but left the following year before completing his degree.

From 1937 until 1939 he held a fellowship at Edinburgh University and did fieldwork in the Sudan and Aden. With the onset of the Second World War, he became a reserve officer in the Territorial Army, but in 1942 he became a staff officer attached to the Ministry of Defence. After the war, Kirwan took the reins of the Royal Geographical Society. Concurrently from 1961 to 1981 he was President of the British Institute in Eastern Africa.In 1958, Kirwan was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), which was raised to Knight Commander in 1972.

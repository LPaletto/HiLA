Line 10 of the Madrid Metro is a rapid transit line in Madrid that is actually the product of two formerly separate lines. Today the route begins at Hospital Infanta Sofía (San Sebastián de los Reyes) and ends at Puerta del Sur (Alcorcón). Passengers must transfer at Tres Olivos between the "line 10A" segment, which covers the portion of the route south of the station, and "line 10B," which extends north to Hospital Infanta Sofía.
Line 10 provides access to the Cuatro Torres Business Area at Begoña station, the AZCA at Nuevos Ministerios, as well as the Chamartín Railway station, Plaza de Castilla, Plaza de España, Principe Pío and Casa de Campo. The line links the towns of Alcobendas and San Sebastián de los Reyes with Madrid.

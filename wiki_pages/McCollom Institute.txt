The McCollom Institute, in Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, until 1871 called the Appleton Academy, was a high school between 1850 and 1906, when it closed due to low numbers. It was owned and operated by the local trustees of a trust which continued for many years after the end of its school.
The building was later the home of the private Stearns Academy until the 1930s, and was then used until the 1980s for the town's public school through grade 6. Now known as the McCollom Building, it is used for town offices and its police station.

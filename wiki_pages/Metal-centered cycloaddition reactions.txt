A metal-centered cycloaddition is a subtype of the more general class of cycloaddition reactions. In such reactions "two or more unsaturated molecules unite directly to form a ring", incorporating a metal bonded to one or more of the molecules. Cycloadditions involving metal centers are a staple of organic and organometallic chemistry, and are involved in many industrially-valuable synthetic processes.
There are two general types of metal-centered cycloaddition reactions: those in which the metal is incorporated into the cycle (a metallocycle), and those in which the metal is external to the cycle. These can be further divided into "true" cycloadditions (those that take place in a concerted fashion), and formal cycloadditions (those that take place in a stepwise fashion). Beyond that, they are classified by the number of atoms contributed to the cycle by each of the participants.
For example, olefin metathesis using a Grubbs catalyst typically involves a reversible [2+2] cycloaddition. A Ruthenium alkylidene and an alkene (or alkyne) react to form a metallocycle.

Niog station is a station under construction on the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 and a proposed station on Line 6. The station will be located on Bacoor Boulevard, about 200 metres away from the intersection with Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor in Cavite. It is part of the Line 1 South Extension Project, being the final station on the planned extension, while it shall be an intermodal terminal with the Line 6 towards Governor's Drive station.
The Line 6 would link the station to the city of Dasmari√±as further along the Molino-Paliparan Road, creating eight more stations. When built, the station will also serve as the new line's northern terminus.

The Pansipit River is a short river located in the Batangas province of the Philippines. The river is the sole drainage outlet of Taal Lake, which empties to Balayan Bay. The river stretches some 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) passing along the municipalities of Agoncillo, Lemery, San Nicolas, and Taal, serving as a boundary between the communities. It has a very narrow entrance from Taal Lake.

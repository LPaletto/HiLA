Andrew Jerome Wurst, 14, fatally shot 48-year-old John Gillette, and wounded another teacher and two students at Nick's Place (a nearby banquet hall) during an 8th grade dinner dance.Prior to the shooting, Andrew Wurst was described as an average student and somewhat of a loner. One student noticed that he had become curt and unfriendly prior to the shooting, and had told others that he wanted to "kill people and commit suicide". He was later sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. He had no diagnosis of mental illness prior to the shooting.

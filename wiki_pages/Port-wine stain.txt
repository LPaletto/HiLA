A port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) is a discoloration of the human skin  caused by a vascular anomaly (a capillary malformation in the skin). They are so named for their coloration, which is similar in color to port wine, a fortified red wine from Portugal.
A port-wine stain is a capillary malformation, seen at birth. Port-wine stains persist throughout life. The area of skin affected grows in proportion to general growth.
Port-wine stains occur most often on the face but can appear anywhere on the body, particularly on the neck, upper trunk, arms and legs. Early stains are usually flat and pink in appearance. As the child matures, the color may deepen to a dark red or purplish color. In adulthood, thickening of the lesion or the development of small lumps may occur.Port-wine stains may be part of a syndrome such as Sturge–Weber syndrome or Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome.

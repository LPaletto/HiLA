The R30 was a New York City Subway car model built by St. Louis Car Company from 1961 to 1962. The cars were a "follow-up" or supplemental stock for the B Division's R27s and closely resembled them. A total of 320 cars were built, arranged in married pairs. Three versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars, General Electric (GE)-powered cars, and R30As.
The first R30s entered service in 1961. Various modifications were made over the years to the R30 fleet, and most of the fleet was refurbished in 1985â€“1989 with a "Redbird" paint scheme. The WH-powered cars were not rebuilt, being replaced by the R68A fleet, and the last train of WH-powered cars ran in passenger service on December 14, 1990. The overhauled R30s and the R30As were planned to run until 1997, but the cars were prematurely phased out starting in 1992 due to the difficulty of installing air-conditioning; the last overhauled R30s ran in passenger service on June 25, 1993. Some R30 cars were saved for various purposes, but most were scrapped.

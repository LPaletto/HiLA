Riverside hosts the Young Womenâ€™s Transition Program (YWTP). The school is affiliated with four districts; Linn-Benton Lincoln Education Service District (ESD) and Lane ESD are due to location but the program is overseen by the Oregon Department of Education Youth Corrections Education Program (YCEP) and Multnomah Education Service District (MSED).

The Round Hill Historic District encompasses the village center of Round Hill, a formerly rural (and now suburban) area in northwestern Greenwich, Connecticut. Centered on the junction of John Street and Round Hill Road, the district includes a church, cemetery, two houses, and a former district school, the latter dating to 1750.  Established as a center for local farmers in the 18th century, it was transformed in the early 20th century into a center for suburban and summer estate residents.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

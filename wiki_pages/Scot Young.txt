Scot Young (Dundee 10 January 1962 – London 8 December 2014) was a Scottish property developer, who came to media attention during a protracted and bitter divorce case brought by his former wife Michelle. He claimed to have lost all his assets in a bad property deal, but his ex-wife claimed he was worth “billions” and that the family court should force Scot to pay her several hundred million pounds.
Michelle managed to persuade the court that Scot had failed to provide complete financial information, and he was jailed for six months. He suffered psychologically, and he received psychiatric support following his release. In 2014, he fell to his death from a window in the London flat of Noelle Reno, his former girlfriend.

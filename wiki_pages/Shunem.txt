Shunaam (Hebrew: שׁוּנֵם; in LXX Ancient Greek: Σουνὰν) was a small village mentioned in the Bible in the possession of the Tribe of Issachar. It was located near the Jezreel Valley, north of Mount Gilboa (Joshua 19:18).  
Shunaam is where the Philistines camped when they fought Saul, the first king of Israel (1 Samuel 28:4). It was the hometown of Abishag, King David's companion in his old age (1 Kings 1:1). The prophet Elisha was hospitably entertained there by a wealthy woman whose deceased son Elisha brought back to life. (2 Kings 4:8)

Shunaam is listed as a town conquered by the Egyptian pharaohs Thutmose III and Shoshenk I.Shunaam may have been located at the site of the modern village of Sulam.

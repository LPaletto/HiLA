The siege of Dublin was an unsuccessful attempt of the last high king of Ireland, Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, to capture the City of Dublin from the Normans in 1171.
Ua Conchobair was allegedly able to gather sixty-thousand men for his cause, meanwhile, the city was held by Strongbow; who had proven his martial prowess just a few months prior, when another Irish army had attempted to seize the city, but Strongbow had been able to drive the besiegers off with a sally.
Ua Conchobair divided his forces into four camps and during the night Strongbow led a surprise attack on Ua Conchobair's camp, killing a thousand and a half, causing the rest of Irish forces to rout.

The Spanish Fork High School Gymnasium at 300 South Main Street (SR-198) in Spanish Fork, Utah, United States is an Art Deco style building built in 1935 by the Public Works Administration.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is not part of the current Spanish Fork High School campus, which is a number of blocks to the northwest of the original gymnasium. Instead it is used by the Nebo School District as part of its main offices.

Temptation: The New Sale of the Century is an American syndicated television game show loosely based on both the original Australian and American Sale of the Century versions, plus the 2005 Australian version, also titled Temptation. The show began airing in syndication on September 10, 2007, with the last first-run episode airing on May 23, 2008. Reruns continued until September 5, 2008.
The series was hosted by Rossi Morreale with former talk show host Rolonda Watts as announcer. Temptation was produced by FremantleMedia North America (logoed as FremantleMedia) and 20th Century Fox Television but was syndicated by 20th Television.
As with other syndicated half-hour programs, Temptation aired two episodes in some markets, with the second episode with a later production date. In July 2008, Temptation was canceled due to low ratings (it was the lowest among game shows during the 2007â€“2008 season) and replaced by Trivial Pursuit: America Plays on most stations.

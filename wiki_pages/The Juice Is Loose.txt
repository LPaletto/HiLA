"The Juice Is Loose" is the ninth episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 15, 2009. In the episode, Peter cashes in an old raffle ticket from 1989 and wins a golf outing with O. J. Simpson. When he befriends Simpson and brings him home to meet the family, the residents of Quahog are not as welcoming of the infamous running back and try to force him out of town.
The episode was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Cyndi Tang. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was viewed in 7.21 million homes in its original airing. The episode received mixed reviews, with most criticism being directed towards the episode's use of a three-minute long live-action segment of Conway Twitty. Series regular Mike Henry provided the voice of O. J. Simpson, Cathy Cahlin Ryan guest starred as Fred Goldman's wife in a cutaway, and Jeff Bergman guest starred as a parody of Homer Simpson.

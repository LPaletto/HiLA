The Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical has been awarded since 1994. Before that time, both plays and musicals were considered together for the Tony Award for Best Revival. The award is given to the best musical play which has already appeared on Broadway in a previous production, or is regarded as being in the common theatrical repertoire. The award goes to the producers of the musical. Like Best Musical, songs from the musicals that are nominated for this award are usually performed during the ceremony before this award is presented.

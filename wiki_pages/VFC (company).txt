VFC Foods is a British vegan food company that began trading in December 2020. An acronym of "Vegan Fried Chick*n", it was founded by Matthew Glover and Adam Lyons in York, England. The company specialises in creating meat substitute products for fried chicken. Glover is the founder of the Veganuary movement and uses his experience in vegan activism to promote the brand.
VFC expanded during its first year of trading, growing from an online store based in York to a company supplying products internationally. PETA have recognised VFC and awarded it with their "Best Vegan Chicken" accolade.

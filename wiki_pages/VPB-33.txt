VPB-33 was a Patrol Bombing Squadron of the U.S. Navy. The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron 33 (VP-33) on 1 April 1942, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron 33 (VPB-33) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 7 April 1945.Squadron Insignia and nickname:

The first squadron insignia was a design originally approved for use by VP-5S. It consisted of a conventional pair of Naval Aviation wings superimposed on a silhouette of the Western Hemisphere and symmetrically
contained in a compass rose. Colors: geographical areas, dark blue; wings, conventional gold; compass rose, red with blue inner ring and black line outer circle. The insignia was frequently referred to as
“Wings Over Panama,” in deference to the squadron's home base in the Panama Canal Zone during the first period of its existence. This design was not officially approved for VP-33 because it was still in use by the
former VP-5S that had gone through numerous redesignations since 1931 and was known as VP-32 and VPB-32 during World War II. It is one of the few instances known where the same design was in use by
two active squadrons at the same time.  

VP-33 was destined to become one of ten well-known Black Cat squadrons operating in the South Pacific during WWII. After reaching the combat zone and being assigned its unique mission, the squadron submitted a new design to CNO. This insignia was approved on 17 April 1944. The black cat, the central character of the design, was shown armed with a telescope and depth charge and superimposed on an enlarged cat's eye. Colors: background, black; eye, orange and lemon yellow; cat, black with yellow outlines; eyeball, yellow; pupil, green; telescope, blue and white; depth charge, light blue with black markings.
This insignia was used by the squadron until its disestablishment in 1945. 
Nickname: Black Cats, 1943–1945.
